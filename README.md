# HOTEL-TRACER
#### 6.2 (9). HotelTracer. ####
The program works with databases of seven world
travel sites: www.HotelQuest.com, www.TravelWeb.com,
www.opodo.com, www.hotels.com, www.orbitz.com, www.AllHotels.com,
www.TravelWorm.com. Each database
is a binary file containing information about
available hotel rooms: city, hotel name, hotel address, room
class (regular, half-luxe, luxe, vip),
number of guests and room price. Room reservation and cancellation functions. Hotel Tracer is looking for the best hotel,
corresponding to the user's request.

Request examples: *"Venice, a prestigious room for two, the price does not matter”, "Sofia, single room at the lowest price”.*
